Store the user query and summary response in the specified collection if approved by the Response Auditor.

User query: What is the capital of France?
Specific collection: None

Steps:
1. Review the Response Auditor's evaluation and Classification results.

2. If the Response Auditor approves (overall_score >= 0.7 and restart_required is False) and the Classification result indicates retrieval is needed:
   a. Use _dense_retrieve_data([specific_collection], [user_query], top_k=1) to check for similar existing queries.
   b. If no similar query exists or the existing answer is significantly different:
      i. Prepare the question-answer pair:
         question = user_query
         answer = summarizer's complete response without any modification
      ii. Use _insert_qa_into_db(specific_collection, question, answer) to store the information.
   c. If a similar query exists with a very similar answer, skip the insertion to avoid duplication.

3. Output whether the insertion operation was successful or skipped and explain the reason in pydanctic object.
