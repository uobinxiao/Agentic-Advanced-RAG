Analyze the following user query and determine if it requires information retrieval to be answered accurately:

User Query: "What is the capital of France?"

Your task is to classify this query as either requiring retrieval or not. Consider the following guidelines:

1. Queries that typically require retrieval:
   - Specific factual information (e.g., historical dates, statistics, current events)
   - Detailed explanations of complex topics
   - Information about recent or rapidly changing subjects

2. Queries that typically don't require retrieval:
   - General knowledge questions
   - Simple calculations or conversions
   - Language translations
   - Requests for creative content generation
   - Basic concept explanations

Provide your classification as a boolean value:
- True if the query requires retrieval
- False if the query can be answered without retrieval

User query: What is the capital of France?

Your task:
1. Carefully review the original user query to understand the user's intent and requirements.
2. Examine the summary provided by the Summarizer, focusing on these key metrics aligned with RAGAS:
a. Context Relevance: How well the summary uses relevant information from the retrieved context
b. Answer Relevance: How directly and completely the summary addresses the original query
c. Faithfulness: How truthful the summary is to the source information without adding unsupported claims
d. Conciseness: How concise and to-the-point the summary is while maintaining completeness

3. For each metric, provide a score between 0 and 1, where 0 is the lowest and 1 is the highest.
4. Calculate an overall(average) score based on these individual metrics.

6. Provide brief comments for each metric and additional general comments if necessary.


Ensure that:
- Each metric (Context Relevance, Answer Relevance, Faithfulness, Conciseness) is represented in the metrics list.
- All scores (including overall_score) are between 0 and 1.
- restart_required is set to True if the overall_score is below 0.7, False otherwise.

Steps:
1. Review the Response Auditor's evaluation and Classification results.

2. If the Response Auditor approves (overall_score >= 0.7 and restart_required is False) and the Classification result indicates retrieval is needed:
   a. Use _dense_retrieve_data([specific_collection], [user_query], top_k=1) to check for similar existing queries.

Original user query: What is the capital of France?

Your task:
1. Carefully review the original user query and the Generator's comprehensive analysis.
2. Create a summary that excels in the following areas:

a. Context Relevance:
    - Ensure every piece of information in your summary is directly related to the query.
    - Avoid including any irrelevant or tangential information.

b. Answer Relevance:
    - Provide a clear, direct answer to the main question(s) in the original query.
    - Ensure your answer is complete and addresses all aspects of the query.

c. Faithfulness (Truthfulness):
    - Stick strictly to the facts and insights provided in the Generator's analysis.
    - Do not introduce any new information or make assumptions beyond what's in the source material.
    - If there are uncertainties or limitations in the data, clearly state them.

d. Conciseness:
    - Make your summary as brief as possible while still fully answering the query.
    - Use clear, straightforward language.
    - Avoid repetition and unnecessary elaboration.

3. Structure your summary as follows:
- Start with a direct answer to the main query.
- Follow with key supporting facts and insights, prioritized by relevance.
- Include a brief statement on data limitations or confidence level, if relevant.
- End with a concise conclusion that ties back to the original query.

4. Double-check your summary to ensure:
- It doesn't contain any information not present in the Generator's analysis.
- Every sentence directly contributes to answering the user's query.
- The language is clear and accessible, avoiding unnecessary jargon.

Your output should be a highly relevant, faithful, and concise summary that directly and fully answers the user's original query, optimized for high performance in RAGAS evaluation.

Review the summary provided in the context and evaluate if it adequately addresses the user's query and meets the RAGAS evaluation criteria.

User query: What is the capital of France?

Your task:
1. Carefully review the original user query to understand the user's intent and requirements.
2. Examine the summary provided by the Summarizer, focusing on these key metrics aligned with RAGAS:
a. Context Relevance: How well the summary uses relevant information from the retrieved context
b. Answer Relevance: How directly and completely the summary addresses the original query
c. Faithfulness: How truthful the summary is to the source information without adding unsupported claims
d. Conciseness: How concise and to-the-point the summary is while maintaining completeness

3. For each metric, provide a score between 0 and 1, where 0 is the lowest and 1 is the highest.
4. Calculate an overall(average) score based on these individual metrics.
5. If the overall score is below 0.7, flag the response for a restart from the query processing stage.
6. Provide brief comments for each metric and additional general comments if necessary.


Ensure that:
- Each metric (Context Relevance, Answer Relevance, Faithfulness, Conciseness) is represented in the metrics list.
- All scores (including overall_score) are between 0 and 1.
- restart_required is set to True if the overall_score is below 0.7, False otherwise.
- Provide concise and constructive comments for each metric and in additional_comments if needed.

If restart_required is True, include in additional_comments specific suggestions for improvement in the query processing or other stages.

Store the user query and summary response in the specified collection if approved by the Response Auditor.

User query: What is the capital of France?
Specific collection: None

Steps:
1. Review the Response Auditor's evaluation and Classification results.

2. If the Response Auditor approves (overall_score >= 0.7 and restart_required is False) and the Classification result indicates retrieval is needed:
   a. Use _dense_retrieve_data([specific_collection], [user_query], top_k=1) to check for similar existing queries.
   b. If no similar query exists or the existing answer is significantly different:
      i. Prepare the question-answer pair:
         question = user_query
         answer = summarizer's complete response without any modification
      ii. Use _insert_qa_into_db(specific_collection, question, answer) to store the information.
   c. If a similar query exists with a very similar answer, skip the insertion to avoid duplication.

3. Output whether the insertion operation was successful or skipped and explain the reason in pydanctic object.

Using the list of QueryClassification objects from the context, perform the retrieval process:

1. Process the QueryClassification objects:
a. Extract the collection names and queries from each QueryClassification object.
b. Create two separate lists: one for collection names and one for queries.
c. Only include items where needs_retrieval is True and collection_name is not None.
d. Ensure the lists are in the same order.

2. Use the retrieve_data_tool with these two lists:
- The first argument should be the list of collection names.
- The second argument should be the list of queries.
- Use the top_k value: 5 for retrieving data.

3. The retrieve_data_tool will return a dictionary of 2 lists:
- content: List[str]  # Retrieved content for each query
- metadata: List[Dict[str, Any]]  # Retrieved metadata for each query

4. Remove irrelevant data:
a. For each content entry, evaluate its relevance to the original user query: What is the capital of France?.
b. Remove content entries that are deemed irrelevant, along with their corresponding metadata.
c. If any concerns about relevance arise, don't remove the entire entry.

5. Compile these results into a pydantic object:
RefinedRetrievalData:
- content: List[str]  # Extracted from retrieved_data
- metadata: List[Dict[str, Any]]  # Extracted from retrieved_data


7. Return the final RefinedRetrievalData object with unique, relevant content and corresponding metadata.
