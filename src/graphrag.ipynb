      "2. Evaluate the query's domain range score\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Queries that typically require retrieval:\n",
      "   - Specific factual information (e.g., historical dates, statistics, current events)\n",
      "   - Detailed explanations of complex topics\n",
      "   - Information about recent or rapidly changing subjects\n",
      "   - Requests for certain content\n",
      "   - Query on a specific document, article, dataset\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Queries that typically don't require retrieval:\n",
      "   - General knowledge questions\n",
      "   - Simple calculations or conversions\n",
      "   - Language translations\n",
      "   - Requests for creative content generation\n",
      "   - Basic concept explanations\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Domain Range Score (0-100):\n",
      "   - 0-35: Highly local or specific queries\n",
      "     • Focuses on a specific location, event, or detailed factual information\n",
      "     • Requires specialized knowledge in a niche area\n",
      "     • Do not require too much integration of minor information\n",
      "     • The answer can be found in one line of the paragraph most of the time\n",
      "     • For example: \"In which month did the Titanic sink?\", \"Who is the author of Game of Thrones?\"\n",
      "   - 36-70: Moderate scope queries\n",
      "     • Covers a few related topics\n",
      "     • Requires knowledge that's common within a particular industry or academic discipline\n",
      "     • Requires integration of minor information to form a response to the user query\n",
      "     • The answer can be found in multiple paragraphs of the article\n",
      "     • For example: \"What are the key factors that contribute to the success of startups in Silicon Valley in this article?\", \"Why does the author choose to use first-person point of view in this article?\"\n",
      "   - 71-100: Broad or global queries\n",
      "     • Addresses universal concepts or global issues  \n",
      "     • Requires integration of knowledge from various domains and multiple summaries.\n",
      "     • The concept may be found in many articles, topics or even multiple books.\n",
      "     • For example: \"What is main idea of this dataset?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional hints for evaluating global vs. local scope:\n",
      "- Assess whether the answer would vary significantly in different parts\n",
      "- Assess whether specialized or general knowledge is required to answer the query\n",
      "- Consider if the query touches on interconnected systems or isolated incidents\n",
      "- Be aware that the query may be specific in one area however if the answer needs to be found in many articles, then the score should be higher.\n",
      "    For example: \"What is the personality of Erick in the article\" should be in range 36-70, because the answer can be found in many articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please provide:\n",
      "1. Whether retrieval is needed (boolean value):\n",
      "   - True if the query requires retrieval\n",
      "   - False if the query can be answered without retrieval\n",

Incarnations and Divine Figures:**\\n- **Chrishna\\'s Last Hours:** \"When Chrishna knew his hour had come, forbidding his disciples to follow him, he repaired to the bank of the River Ganges; and having performed three ablutions, he knelt down, and looking up to heaven, he prayed to Brahma.\" This indicates a significant moment of transition for Chrishna, emphasizing his divine nature.\\n- **Second Advent of Chrishna:** \"There is not a Hindoo or a Brahmin who does not look upon the second coming of Chrishna as an established article of faith.\" The Vedas and Gita prophesy his return, describing him as \"crowned with lights\" and stating that \"all men, all animated beings, beasts, birds, trees, and plants, will chant his praises.\"\\n- **Sakia (Buddha) and the Ninth Avatar:** The text mentions a saint who recognized the new avatar, Sakia, and declared him to be the \"great avatar (Savior or prophet).\" This suggests a parallel between Chrishna and Sakia in their roles as saviors.\\n\\n**B. Resurrection and Ascension:**\\n- **Ascension of Sakia:** \"Of the ninth incarnation of India, the Savior Sakia, it is declared, that he \\'ascended to the celestial regions\\'.\" This reflects a common theme of ascension found in various religious narratives.\\n- **Prometheus and Christ:** The text draws parallels between the crucified Prometheus and Christ, noting that both figures experienced death and ascension, with Christ\\'s soul \"not left in hell\" and \"he rose again from the dead, and ascended into heaven.\"\\n\\n**C. Prophecies and Beliefs:**\\n- **Destruction and Renewal:** \"A glorious, blissful future attends the destruction of the world by fire, and the reappearance of Vishnu... the last coming of Vishnu in power and glory.\" This indicates a cyclical belief in destruction and renewal within Hinduism.\\n- **Cultural Practices:** The text describes rituals performed by Taoist priests and bonzes, indicating the cultural significance of these beliefs in the context of death and the afterlife.\\n\\n**D. Historical Context and Literature:**\\n- **Geological and Cosmogonic Accounts:** The text references geological periods and their relation to creation narratives, noting that \"these 6 periods or _yums_... do not answer exactly to the 6 _yums_ or manifestations of the mosaic cosmogony.\" This highlights the intersection of scientific and religious narratives.\\n\\n**2. Connections and Contradictions:**\\n- There is a clear connection between the themes of resurrection and ascension across different cultures, as seen in the figures of Chrishna, Sakia, and Christ. However, the text does not provide a definitive location for the fifth incarnation, leaving a gap in the information.\\n- The belief in a second coming is consistent across various traditions, yet the specifics of each tradition\\'s expectations differ, indicating a rich tapestry of beliefs that may not align perfectly.\\n\\n**3. Gaps in Information:**\\n- The specific location of the fifth incarnation is not mentioned in the retrieved data, indicating a lack of information on this aspect.\\n- There is insufficient detail regarding the rituals performed by the Taoist priests and their significance in relation to the themes of resurrection and ascension.\\n\\n**4. Relevant Metadata:**\\n- Source: .txt/gutenberg.txt\\n- The information is derived from various texts discussing religious beliefs, prophecies, and cultural practices, emphasizing the interconnectedness of these themes across different traditions.\\n\\nThis organized output serves as a comprehensive representation of the original data, preserving the integrity and nuances of the information for future processing and response generation.']}}\n",

Additionally, Malkovich is portrayed as a well-respected actor of the 20th century, who becomes the subject of a supernatural portal that allows others to experience the world through his eyes, further complicating the notions of self and reality.\\n\\nIn a striking visual representation, Malkovich is depicted as a larger-than-life figure seated on a jeweled throne, adorned with a crown and robe, exuding an air of superiority.

This admiration culminates in a surreal experience where Lotte temporarily assumes Malkovich's identity, marking a pivotal moment in her journey of self-discovery. Additionally, Malkovich is portrayed as a well-respected actor of the 20th century, who becomes the subject of a supernatural portal that allows others to experience the world through his eyes, further complicating the notions of self and reality.\\n\\nIn a striking visual representation, Malkovich is depicted as a larger-than-life figure seated on a jeweled throne, adorned with a crown and robe, exuding an air of superiority. This imagery reinforces his status as an idol and a symbol of aspiration, particularly for characters like Erroll, who wishes to embody an idealized version of himself through Malkovich.

Malkovich's involvement in the unfolding events is highlighted by his invitation to Maxine's apartment, indicating his integral role in the complex relationships that develop around him.\\n\\nHe is idolized by Lotte, who has created a shrine in his honor, showcasing her deep admiration and the extent to which she is influenced by his persona. This admiration culminates in a surreal experience where Lotte temporarily assumes Malkovich's identity, marking a pivotal moment in her journey of self-discovery. Additionally, Malkovich is portrayed as a well-respected actor of the 20th century, who becomes the subject of a supernatural portal that allows others to experience the world through his eyes, further complicating the notions of self and reality.\\n\\nIn a striking visual representation, Malkovich is depicted as a larger-than-life figure seated on a jeweled throne, adorned with a crown and robe, exuding an air of superiority. This imagery reinforces his status as an idol and a symbol of aspiration, particularly for characters like Erroll, who wishes to embody an idealized version of himself through Malkovich. Ultimately, John Malkovich emerges as a complex character whose identity and experiences serve as a lens through which the narrative explores deeper societal values and the intricacies of human connection.\", 'The cabbie recognizes John Malkovich, indicating a relationship based on public recognition and celebrity status.', 'This community centers around the interactions between the crowd and key figures such as Robert Brown and Malkovich, highlighting the complex dynamics of audience engagement, spiritual influence, and the reactions to performances and events.

A very rich spendthrift\\nmight do this, you will say, saving at the spigot and wasting at the\\nbung; but so far as my observation goes, Jeffard seems not to know\\nthat his barrel has a bung. And if any of the staves have started on the side of dissipation, the leak is not yet apparent to me. The other\\nevening, when I let drive a little arrow pointed with a gibe at his\\npenuriousness, he laughed and reminded me of something he had said one\\nnight in the famine time when we were dining by the help of a small\\nwindfall of mine. \"I told you I should be a miser if the tide ever\\nturned,\" said he, \"and you scoffed at me. I assure you I can account\\nfor every dollar I have spent since the Midas began to pour them in.\"', 'metadata': '{\"source\": \".txt/gutenberg.txt\"}'}]\n",

We had trips to Christchurch to do our research, but once we started working on the film, we moved there for nearly five months, so it was an ideal opportunity to find others. We\\'d hear things about this person who had sat next to Pauline in typing class, and we\\'d rush around to see them.\\n\\nI\\'m sure the production got a certain amount of notice in the local media, so people probably approached you.\\n\\nPJ: To an extent, but not as much as what we had hoped. Pauline\\'s people were actually quite difficult to research, because they just weren\\'t public; they were quite private people. FW: We have heard, subsequently, that Pauline\\'s sister, Wendy, has seen the film. She still lives in Christchurch. Her con meets were that the film managed to capture the atmosphere of her home at that time, but her criticism was that the family was \"better\" than that, we had portrayed them in too shabby a light.

      "Final Answer: Over the last decade, Alexis Paulvitch has endured a life marked by extreme suffering, both physically and psychologically. Initially, he fled into the jungle to escape the terror of Tarzan and the savage beasts, only to fall into the hands of a cannibal tribe. This decision led to a decade of misery and torture, where he became the target of relentless abuse from the tribe's members. Paulvitch was subjected to beatings, stonings, and disfigurement at the hands of the tribe, which left him in a state of constant physical pain and marked by severe illnesses, including smallpox. His physical appearance deteriorated to such an extent that he became unrecognizable, aging prematurely due to the harsh conditions and brutal treatment he faced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychologically, Paulvitch's experience has been equally devastating. He has been consumed by feelings of hatred and resentment, not only towards the tribe that tormented him but also towards Nicholas Rokoff, the man whose actions led him into this horrific existence. His mind has become a prison of morbid thoughts, filled with a blighting emotion of hate that has transformed him into a personification of his suffering. This emotional turmoil has left him devoid of any thoughts of revenge, instead fostering a dull hatred that permeates his waking life.\n",
      "\n",
      "After ten years of torment, Paulvitch was rescued and taken aboard the Marjorie W., where he received care and nourishment. However, despite this rescue, he remained a \"human derelict,\" battered and wrecked, with little hope for recovery. His appearance did not improve, and he continued to carry the emotional scars of his past. He adopted the name Michael Sabrov, further distancing himself from his former identity as Alexis Paulvitch, which signifies a profound transformation brought about by his experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the last decade of Alexis Paulvitch's life has been characterized by extreme physical suffering, emotional turmoil, and a profound sense of loss and hatred.

The lack of information regarding his life post-rescue leaves gaps in understanding how he coped with his trauma or if he found any semblance of peace or rehabilitation.

We will take a wife, a woman\\n of uncommon beauty and intellect, who\\n is, as yet, still an infant herself. We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in\\n her hair.
