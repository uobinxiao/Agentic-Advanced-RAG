Its exact wording in a release issued this afternoon: Altman’s “departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.” What the hell is happening at the most hyped company in the world?! Here are some totally speculative theories that occurred to us and others around the web.\\n\\n1. Did Altman circumvent the board in a major deal?\\n\\nBased on the board’s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now. “Not consistently candid” is a very diplomatic way of saying Altman lied. It’s possible that Altman — and potentially OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who stepped down as chairman simultaneously, then resigned — wanted to make a bold move that he knew the board would not like. It’s not uncommon for these deals to be hammered out quietly in smoke- (or vape-) filled rooms and then presented as a fait accompli, but if it was controversial enough and the board found out about these maneuvers, it could be fuel for an ouster.; <Metadata> title: WTF is going on at OpenAI? We have theories, source: TechCrunch, published_at: 2023-11-18T00:09:53+00:00', 'them. But one can never be sure. 4. Could it be a major security or privacy incident?\\n\\nThe idea that the company has experienced a major, perhaps pervasive, security issue is bolstered by the fact that Microsoft reportedly suspended use of ChatGPT internally a few days ago. OpenAI subsequently stopped allowing new signups. If there was a serious security problem in its biggest product and Altman downplayed it, that would obviously create distrust with the board. There is also the potential for misuse at scale with the enormous amount of personal data that travels through OpenAI’s APIs and services.; <Metadata> title: WTF is going on at OpenAI? We have theories, source: TechCrunch, published_at: 2023-11-18T00:09:53+00:00', 'But if Microsoft was as shocked as the rest of us, as one report has it, it could hardly be the kind of high-stakes conspiracy some seem to be hoping for. But one must assume that Microsoft would say that either way. Even if they’d been working with Altman on some kind of secret plan, they can truthfully say they were surprised by his firing. (And they “remain committed to our partnership.”)\\n\\n2. Do they disagree on long-term strategy? Despite being the hottest tech company in the world right now and everyone talking about ChatGPT, OpenAI isn’t exactly a sound business. It’s shoveling money into the furnace as fast as it can by serving, by all accounts, a fantastically expensive product at bargain-bin prices.\\n\\nThat’s all well and good for a year or two, but at some point that strategy changes from a growth hack to an existential liability. Could Altman and the board have had irreconcilable differences on where that point lies? This doesn’t seem so likely. The company has been very deliberately pursuing this very publicly, confidently and on a long-term basis. Altman and the board seem to be in sync on this, at least for the present.\\n\\n3. Do the numbers not add up?\\n\\nOn the other hand, could OpenAI be losing even more money than Altman admitted or projected?

Bankman-Fried, who informed us he’s “somewhat introverted, naturally,” gave us a rather prolonged tour of his pre-Alameda Research life, which I will skip.

You could say that confused message is very apt for cryptocurrency, where the process by which it works is forever murky and often misrepresented, at least to most people. If SBF didn’t intentionally aim to cynically defraud a bunch of people, in the long run he became one of the many who disastrously failed to manage the risk inherent in crypto speculation. That’s ultimately what happened with FTX, as financial discrepancies racked up between the exchange and its sister company Alameda Research (a trader itself on the platform).

What he did not do was create a risk team, which he is now characterizing as a “big mistake.” Risk is an inherent part of a futures exchange, which is even more like a casino than regular cryptocurrency. Not having a risk team, when you are any kind of financial anything, is certainly a choice. It is especially a choice when you go around telling everyone your crypto exchange is very good and safe. FTX’s big selling point was its “risk engine,” which was supposed to prevent big losses that would then be spread around all the rest of the customers. But Bankman-Fried testified that in 2020, the “risk engine was effectively sagging under the weight” of the exchange’s rapid growth. So its time to liquidation went up — it took minutes to determine which accounts needed to be liquidated. As a result, at one point the risk engine got stuck in a catastrophic feedback loop that would have created losses in; <Metadata> title: The jury finally hears from Sam Bankman-Fried, source: The Verge, published_at: 2023-10-28T00:12:41+00:00', '\"Overnight, we started receiving hundreds of reports about unusual activity by customers of financial institutions in the State of Israel,\" she says.

Though FTX hadn’t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto.

I think it’s important for people to think I look crazy.”) Because he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals.

This valuation was allegedly based on an exaggerated size claim, stating the apartment was nearly three times its actual size. Furthermore, the prosecution argues that this inflated valuation was strategically increased from $200 million to $327 million between 2014 and 2015 to mask a decline in the value of another property owned by Trump. This pattern of behavior has led to legal actions against him, with accusations of fraud and manipulation of asset values to enhance his financial standing. \\n\\nIn summary, the individual in question is Donald Trump, who is facing serious allegations regarding the manipulation of real estate valuations for personal gain.\"}}\n"
