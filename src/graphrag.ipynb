As the need for peace becomes more urgent, this fundamental contradiction, which hinders its realization, demands a reassessment of the assumptions\\nupon which the commonly held view of mankindâs historical predicament is based. Dispassionately examined, the evidence reveals that such conduct, far from expressing manâs true self, represents a distortion of the human\\nspirit. Satisfaction on this point will enable all people to set in motion\\nconstructive social forces which, because they are consistent with human\\nnature, will encourage harmony and co-operation instead of war and\\nconflict. To choose such a course is not to deny humanityâs past but to understand it. The BahÃâÃ Faith regards the current world confusion and calamitous\\ncondition in human affairs as a natural phase in an organic process\\nleading ultimately and irresistibly to the unification of the human race\\nin a single social order whose boundaries are those of the planet.

It was a very simple little story, but it caught the mens attention at\\nonce, being about two soldiers in a hospital during the late war, both badly wounded in the right arm, and both anxious to save these\\nbreadwinners and go home unmaimed. One was patient, docile, and cheerfully obeyed orders, even when told that the arm must go. He\\nsubmitted and after much suffering recovered, grateful for life, though\\nhe could fight no more. The other rebelled, would listen to no advice, and having delayed too long, died a lingering death, bitterly regretting\\nhis folly when it was too late.
