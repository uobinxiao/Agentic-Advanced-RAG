We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well, for\\nwe thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp\\nknife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble. However, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being\\nbrought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a\\nstatement, which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our\\nshorthand man. We had three copies typewritten, one of which I\\nenclose.

Its not that I\\nwant to clear myself. I know that I went back to drink, like the beast\\nthat I was. But she would have forgiven me; she would have stuck as\\nclose to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our\\ndoor. For Sarah Cushing loved me--thats the root of the business--she\\nloved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that\\nI thought more of my wifes footmark in the mud than I did of her whole\\nbody and soul. \"There were three sisters altogether.

And then we asked\\nSarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one thing led\\nto another, until she was just one of ourselves. \"I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little money\\nby, and all was as bright as a new dollar.
