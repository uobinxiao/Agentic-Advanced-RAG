       "  ' the Marina, whatever was the _festa_ or the\\n fireworks; but now nothing would serve her but that\\n she must go to help in the war. She had money, for the\\n cake-shop had done well all these years, and she must\\n needs go and spend her money in learning nursing in\\n Naples. All of a sudden it was so with her, and one\\n day a month ago she asked me to come down with her to\\n see her forth. And when we came to the Marina, Signor, she shut her eyes, for she could not bear to see it, and asked me to lead her along the quay to where the\\n boats took off the passengers by the steamer. All along\\n the quay I led her, she with eyes closed; but when we\\n came to the steps, where Vincenzo had landed and fell\\n into her arms a stricken man, then at last she opened\\n her eyes, or the tears opened them, and she fell on\\n her knees and kissed the place where Vincenzo had been\\n joined to her. She kissed it, and she kissed it, and\\n then suddenly her tears dried, and she stepped into\\n the boat and waved her hand to her friends and said: Vincenzo wishes it; Vincenzo wishes it. Oh, a brave\\n woman! she had not baked her heart in the cake-shop. \"My humble duty to you, excellency, Seraphina has no\\n more to say, but that often the step goes up and down\\n in the studio. I think, as Donna Margherita said, that\\n someone guards the house. It is as a sentry, who makes\\n the house secure. But it will be a good day when I hear\\n there the steps of the Signorino and of you. All humble\\n compliments and the good wishes of a friend who is\\n Seraphina. \"_Scusi! _ Shall I sow the flower seeds in the garden\\n that were saved from last year? If the Signori will\\n not be here in the spring, what need to sow them, for\\n they will keep, will they not? But if there is a chance\\n of your coming, the garden must needs be gay with a\\n welcome. \"\\n\\nRight in the middle of the black cloud of war there came a rift, as I\\nread Seraphinas budget of news. Some breeze parted the folds of it, and I saw a peep of blue sky and bluer sea, and the stone-pine and\\nthe terraced gardens, with the morning-glory rioting on the wall. But\\nhow incredibly remote it seemed, as if it belonged to some previous\\ncycle of existence; as if the closed doors of eternity that swing\\nshut when we are born had opened again, and I looked on some previous\\nincarnation. I thought I remembered (before the war came) experiences\\nlike those which Seraphinas letter suggested, but they seemed like\\nthe affairs of childhood, when imagination is so mixed up with reality\\nthat we scarcely know whether there are robbers in the shrubbery or\\nnot. We pretend that there are, and even while we pretend dusk falls\\nand the shrubbery has to be passed, and we are not certain whether\\nthere are not robbers there, after all. It was so with the recollection\\nof the things of which Seraphina spoke (and even they were mixed up\\nwith war). I felt I might have dreamed them, or have invented them for\\nmyself, or have experienced them in some pre-natal existence. Just\\nthat one glimpse I had of them, and no more; then the rift in the\\nclouds closed up again, and blacker than ever before, except perhaps\\nduring the days of the Retreat from Mons, grew the gigantic bastion\\nof storm through which we had to pass. Even so once, thunderclouds\\ncollected before me when I was on the top of an Alpine peak, gathering\\nand growing thicker with extraordinary swiftness. A rent came in them\\nfor a moment, and through it we could see the pastures and villages ten\\nthousand feet below. Then it closed up, and we had to pass through the\\nclouds out of which already the lightning was leaping before we could\\narrive on the safe familiar earth again. I could scarcely realize, then, what life was like before the war, and now, looking forward, it seemed impossible to imagine that there\\ncould be any end to the murderous business. This month a wave of\\npessimism swept over London; even those who had been most optimistic\\nwere submerged in it; and all that was possible was to go on, the more\\noccupied the better, and, anyhow, not to talk about it. A dozen times\\nhad our hopes flared high; a dozen times they had been extinguished. Only a few months ago',\n",

From below a hawk swooped\\nupwards over the cliff edge, saw us, and fell away again with a rustle\\nof reversed feathers into the air. Round the base of the cliffs the\\nsapphire of the sea was trimmed with brilliant bottle-green, and not\\nthe faintest line of foam showed where it met the land. To the left on\\nthe island, the town of Alatri, with all its house-roofs and spires, looked as flat as on a map, and on the hill-side above it we could\\njust make out the stone-pine cutting the white faÃade of the Villa\\nTiberiana. For a moment that anchored me to earth; but slipping my\\ncable again, I spread myself abroad in the openness and the emptiness. Was I part of it, or it part of me? That did not matter much; we were\\ncertainly both part of something else, something of tumultuous energy\\nthat whirled the stars on their courses, and was yet the peace that\\npassed understanding. The days had slipped away. Before the orange lilies, which we gathered\\nthat afternoon on Monte Gennaro, were withered, there remained to me\\nbut a week more for the present of island life, which flowed on hour\\nby hour in the normal employments that made up the day. But all the\\nsmall events, the sights and sounds, had to me then, as they have now, a curious distinctness, as when before a storm outlines of hills and\\nhouses are sharp and defined, and the details of the landscape are\\netched vividly in the metallic tenseness of the preceding calm. But, as\\nfar as I knew, there were in life generally no threats of approaching\\nstorm, no clouds that broke the serenity of the sky. Privately, my\\nfriendships and affairs were prosperous, and though by the papers it\\nappeared that politicians were turning anxious eyes to Ireland, where\\nferment was brewing over Home Rule, I supposed, in the happy-go-lucky\\nway in which the average English citizen goes whistling along, that\\nthose whose business it was to attend to such things would see to it. Personally I intended to go back to England for a couple of months, and\\nthen return here for the warm golden autumn that often lasts into the\\nearly days of December. Established now, in this joint house, \"_piccolo\\nnido in vasto mar, _\" I meant to slide back often and for prolonged\\nperiods down the golden cord that has always bound me to Italy. But\\nthough these days were so soon to be renewed, I found myself clinging\\nto each minute as it passed with a sense that they were numbered; that\\nthe sands were running out, and that close behind the serenity of the\\nheavens there lurked the flare of some prodigious judgment. Yet, day\\nby day there was nothing to warrant those ominous presages. I swam\\nto my cache, smoked my cigarette, basked on the beach, and continued\\nweaving the adventures of Mrs. Hancock. The same sense of instability, I found, beset Francis also, and this in spite of the fact that the\\nbeleaguerings of Miss Machonochie were suddenly and celestially put a\\nstop to. We had strolled down to the Piazza one evening after dinner, and\\nmingled with the crowd that stood watching a great display of\\nthunderstorm that was bursting over the mainland twenty miles away. Above us here was a perfectly clear sky, in which the full moon rode\\nhigh, and by its light we could see that the whole of the coast was\\nsmothered in cloud, out of which broke ten times to the minute flashes\\nof lightning, while the low, remote roar of the thunder, faintly echoed\\non the cliffs of Monte Gennaro, boomed without ceasing. Then we saw\\nthat long streamers of cloud were shooting out of that banked rampart\\ntowards us, and we had barely got back to the Villa again before the\\nmoon and the stars were obscured, and hot single drops of rain, large\\nas a five-franc piece, steamed and vanished on the warm cement of the\\nterrace. All night long the rain fell in sheets, and through the slats of\\nthe shutters I saw the incessant flashes, while the thunder roared\\nand rattled overhead, and the pipe from the house-roof, that feeds\\nour depleted cistern, gurgled and gulped and swallowed the rain it\\nwas thirsting for. Hour after hour the downpour continued, and when\\nmorning broke the garden-paths were riddled with water-courses, and\\nthe gathered waters gleamed in the cist',\n",
